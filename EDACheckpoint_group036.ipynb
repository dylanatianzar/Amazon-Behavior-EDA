    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project examines what factors impact a consumer's shopping satisfaction on Amazon. Reviews play an important role for various businesses, such as restaurants and the service industry, where feedback from previous customers can significantly impact the decisions of potential customers regarding where to dine or obtain services. We are interested in the relationship between product reviews and consumer purchases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many factors can go into an individual’s decision into buying something such as personal research into the product or the product being recommended to them, but we believe previous reviews are the most significant factor. A study in 2022 utilizing eye tracking software experimented with reviews for a phone and whether a participant ended up buying the phone. The researchers found that consumers pay more attention towards negative reviews than the positives correlating with whether they do purchase the product or not. They also uncovered that there’s a difference between the importance of reviews between men and women. The men were primarily focused on the hardware specifications of a phone while the women factored the reviews into their decision [1]. Initially, we hadn’t thought about the subgroups within consumers so there’s also more to reveal in that area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another study conducted in 2022 looks through the results of a survey to gain insights into the relationship between consumer purchases and its reviews. It found that consumers judge reviews based on their credibility. This credibility can be derived from the volume of reviews, the language used by the reviewer and general average score of the reviews. These elements all lead to whether or not reviews end up being a contributing factor of a consumer’s purchase decision [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, these studies state that consumers do take note of product reviews and their significance toward a consumer. The research does indicate a correlation between a customer’s purchase decision and the product’s overall sentiment. Furthermore, we recognize the credibility of these reviews factor into a consumer’s purchase decision. However, we aim to find the extent to which these reviews affect a consumer’s overall shopping satisfaction on the Amazon platform.\n",

    "# Hypothesis\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Our hypothesis is that a consumer's age, gender, frequency of browsing on Amazon, interaction with Amazon's personalized recommendations, and perception toward customer reviews significantly affect their shopping satisfaction on Amazon in 2023. Specifically, we predict that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Age:** Younger consumers (millennials, gen Z) are more likely to be influenced by personalized recommendations and customer reviews, leading to higher shopping satisfaction. In contrast, older consumers may place more value on product quality and reliability over personalized suggestions\n",
    "2. **Gender:** Shopping satisfaction may vary by gender, with women potentially placing higher importance on customer reviews and personalized recommendations compared to men, who might focus more on product specifications and performance\n",
    "3. **Frequency of browsing:** Consumers who browse Amazon frequently are more likely to interact with personalized recommendations and read customer reviews, resulting in higher shopping satisfaction due to better-informed purchase decisions\n",
    "4. **Interaction with personalized recommendations:** Consumers who actively engage with Amazon's personalized recommendations are expected to experience higher shopping satisfaction, as these recommendations are tailored to their preferences and browsing history\n",
    "5. **Perception toward customer reviews:** Consumers who have a positive perception of customer reviews and trust peer feedback are likely to report higher shopping satisfaction. Conversely, those skeptical of reviews may rely more on other factors, such as product descriptions and brand reputation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is based on the assumption that shopping satisfaction is multifaceted and influenced by a combination of demographic factors and engagement with Amazon's platform features. Younger consumers and frequent browsers are presumed to be more tech savvy and receptive to personalized content, enhancing their shopping experience. Gender differences in shopping behavior suggest varying priorities and influences on satisfaction. Trust in customer reviews plays a critical role, as reviews often include valuable insight to help mitigate purchase risks. We aim to understand how different elements contribute to shopping satisfaction on Amazon in 2023 by analyzing these factors."

    "- In our ideal dataset, we specifically want our data to be based on a consumer's Amazon experience. We would like a lot of data points relating to consumer description such as age, gender, location, income level, ethnicity and the like to generalize the findings across all consumers. Besides those, we would also want a categorical variable if product reviews helped an individual’s purchase and the average stars of that product. Others would also be related to the product such as product category, whether or not they bought it and how deeply they engaged with the review such as skimmed or fully read. Then, it should detail how users interacted with various Amazon features such as Amazon prime and Amazon recommendations. These should all come together in order to properly rate a consumer's shopping satisfaction on Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There would be at least 1000 observations in order to get a better gauge of the statistical significance related to the data as well as allow enough analysis across all groups and factors that contribute towards Amazon consumer satisfaction. Ideally, a resource directly from Amazon should collect this data as they have the ability to gain that much data and their reliable, or a small study conducted across all markets can be useful too. This data would be stored in a .csv format preferably."

    "The Amazon Customer Behavior Dataset provides a collection of information about consumer interactions and browsing patterns while using Amazon. The key variables in this dataset include: the 'age' and 'gender' of the user, the frequency at which they interact with Amazon (measured in browsing, purchasing and Amazon's recommendation system usage), their perception towards Amazon's product reviews (measured by whether they find reviews helpful and reliable) and how they would rate their overall shopping satisfaction on Amazon. The datatypes included in this dataset are integers and strings (Note: strings denoted as objects as the datatype). In order to process this dataset, we need to clean the data by removing missing values and wrangling by modifying the dataset to only look at our key variables instead of all 23 variables. Furthermore, the object-type columns are comprised of various \"Yes\"/\"No\" and frequency rankings such as \"Rarely\"/\"Sometimes\" and so on, so we can change these to nominal values such as 1 and 0 for the Y/N and numbers for the frequency rankings."

    "#### Ethical considerations:\n",
    "In our project, we thoroughly evaluated ethical concerns throughout the entire research process. Our commitment is to ensure that every step adheres to the highest ethical standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data collection and bias considerations\n",
    "During the data collection process, we evaluated ethical concerns, particularly regarding the dataset's source and its implications. We selected the Amazon Consumer Behavior dataset, which was collected through online surveys predominantly conducted in the Indian subcontinent. While this dataset provides valuable real world insights, we believe there are some limitations in terms of generalizability. The survey population primarily includes people who use Amazon and are willing to share information about their shopping habits. Consequently, the findings may not be representative of the entire consumer population (due to various statistical underrepresentations) or applicable to regions outside the Indian subcontinent, as specified by the survey description.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mitigating potential biases\n",
    "To address these biases, we took several measures:\n",
    "1. **Transparency with participants:** We ensured that in the data set we chose, survey participants were explicitly informed about the survey's purpose and the intended use of their data (survey was voluntarily conducted through a dedicated Google Form)\n",
    "2. **Exploratory data analysis:** We conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to identify any anomalies, missing values, and patterns that could indicate biases\n",
    "3. **Data cleaning:** We cleaned the dataset to minimize biases, ensuring that the data used in our analysis is as accurate and unbiased as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical handling of data\n",
    "We are committed to addressing any biases, privacy concerns, and terms of use issues associated with our dataset:\n",
    "- **Bias detection and mitigation:** We will employ statistical techniques and bias detection tools to identify and mitigate biases before, during, and after the analysis. This includes evaluating the demographic composition of our dataset and adjusting our analysis methods to account for any identified biases\n",
    "- **Privacy:** we have implemented robust measures to protect the privacy of survey participants. This includes anonymizing data and ensuring that any personally identifiable information is removed/obfuscated\n",
    "- **Equitablity:** We're mindful of the potential impact of our findings on different populations. We will strive to communicate our results transparently, highlighting any limitations and ensuring that our conclusions are equitable and do not generalize across different demographics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Addressing ethical issues\n",
    "Our group acknowledges that no dataset is entirely free from biases. Throughout our project, we will do the following as needed:\n",
    "- **Monitor for ethical concerns:** Regularly review our methodology and results for any emerging ethical issues\n",
    "- **Adjust methodologies:** Be prepared to adjust our analysis methods to address any identified biases or ethical concerns\n",
    "- **Transparent communication:** Communicate our findings with full transparency, acknowledging the limitations and potential biases of our dataset\n"
